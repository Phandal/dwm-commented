Do not use. Do not patch.

This fork of dwm adds extra comments and is intended for educational uses only. If you try to patch
this version of dwm then that will most likely fail, more so the relative comments will no longer
apply or be misleading as the underlying code will have changed.

If you are interested in dwm then get a fresh clone from the https://dwm.suckless.org/ site and use
this as a reference rather than the basis for your build.

This fork has 0 patches and also do not cover patches.
